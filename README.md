🖼️ Image Restoration Using Deep Generative Models
🧠 Problem Statement
Image degradation is common in real-world visual data due to noise, compression artifacts, occlusion, or partial corruption. This project builds an image restoration system that can recover and reconstruct high-quality images from degraded inputs using deep generative models.

The goal is to design a model that restores corrupted images to clean, high-fidelity versions and provides a user-friendly interface for image upload, restoration, and download.

📊 Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Description
PSNR	Measures the signal-to-noise ratio between restored and original images
SSIM	Structural Similarity Index for perceptual quality
LPIPS	Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity for feature-space accuracy
Latency	Time taken for model inference during image restoration
Use the following command to run evaluations:

python utils/evaluation.py
🚀 How It Works
Image Collection

Use utils/image_scraper.py to collect original images from the web.
Dataset Preparation

Corrupt images using utils/corruption_utils.py.
Split the dataset using utils/split_dataset.py.
Training

Train your RealESRGANer model on the dataset.
Save checkpoints in model_training/model_after_training/.
Visualization

View original vs corrupted samples using:
visuals/varify.py
visuals/visualize_samples.py
Web App

Launch the interface using:
streamlit run app.py
Upload a corrupted image to preview and download the restored version.
✅ Example Commands
# Run the web application
streamlit run app.py

# Evaluate model performance
python utils/evaluation.py

# Visualize original vs corrupted samples
python visuals/varify.py
